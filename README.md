# Book-Recommendation
#### Recommendation systems are often used as support for different services across multiple sectors. These systems are designed to produce a series of individualized recommendations through either content based or a collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering involves building a model based on past behavior of a user to predict items that a typical user might be interested in.
